# Tracing AI-Generated Content: A Metadata-Enriched Dataset for Bias & Misinformation Analysis  

Large language models (LLMs) shape public discourse but often amplify misinformation and biases. This project introduces a metadata-enriched dataset to trace AI-generated content origins, identify biases, and assess misinformation propagation.  

By integrating verified news, social media, and misinformation repositories, we analyze AI behavior across public health, politics, conflicts, and social issues. Our approach includes:  
- **Bias & misinformation detection**  
- **Transparency in AI information usage**  
- **Responsible AI benchmarking**  

This dataset informs bias mitigation, prompt engineering, and AI governance.
